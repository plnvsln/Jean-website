        <h1>About Me</h1>

        <h2 class="about-me-h2">
          I was born within the sound of Bow Bells, East London and at the age
          of five I moved with my family to Hampshire which is where I still
          live.

              Throughout my childhood, my favourite pastime was drawing and I
              was encouraged by those who saw my work telling me I had a natural
              talent.
            </p>
            <p>
              On leaving school I worked for a large organisation. My colleagues
              soon became aware of my love for art & asked me to draw/paint
              pictures for them. Word of my artwork travelled fast & and I
              shortly had an endless stream of paying customers with commissions
              mainly for portraits of customers pets, family & friends.
            </p>
            <p>
              Art commissions gave way to nurturing years of motherhood. Upon my
              children becoming self-sufficient & leaving home I was very happy
              to once again, resume my commissioned based work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I can honestly to say that I thoroughly love & enjoy my work as an
              artist. I have great pleasure in completing commissions to
              extremely happy & satisfied customers!! ​
