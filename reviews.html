            Thank you Jean for a wonderful drawing. The detail is amazing,
            you’ve captured him perfectly. He almost feels like he is in my
            room!

            I have a beautiful commissioned piece of art by Jean, which takes
            pride of place on my salon wall and is the focal point which gets
            everybody talking, this eye catching piece of art describes my salon
            without me even saying a word! You are amazing Jean I tell everyone
            to take a look at your wonderful art at jeanhart_ca on instagram.

            I have had the privilege of knowing Jean for a number of years and
            already own some of her work. I recently commissioned one of her
            fine black ink line abstract pieces, which I am delighted with. I
            love the way it draws your eye into the several focal points, the
            touches of red alongside the gold, the intricate design and delicate
            detail show me something different each time I look at it.

            This stunning drawing commissioned by Jean of my JaguarXKR captures
            the beautiful lines of this car much better than any photos I have.
            The low stance and aggressive expression is translated through the
            skilful use of shading and highlighting.
